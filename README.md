## Here are several documents, namely:

### Notes
Notes that I take during theoretical lectures in Markdown <br>

### Project: OnlyFEUP Social Network (Grade: 18.6/20)

The main goal of the OnlyFEUP project is the development of a web-based social network with the purpose of creating connections between students and staff, sharing resources about courses and subjects. This is a tool that can be used by anyone from FEUP. After signing up and verifying the user is related to the university (students/teachers), they can start using it for a better experience at FEUP. <br>
Last year OnlyFEUP was also available online in the following link: `https://lbaw2255.lbaw.fe.up.pt`

All OnlyFEUP documentation is available in [Project](./Project/) folder:

- [Wiki](./Project/Wiki/), in markdown
- [Video Demo](./Project/docs/lbaw2255.mp4)
- [Final Report](./Project/Report.pdf) in PDF format with more than 200 pages
