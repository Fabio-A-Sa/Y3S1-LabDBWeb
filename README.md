### Notes

Notes I took during lectures on Markdown in the 22/23 edition of LBAW. As a LBAW monitor in the year 23/24 I intend to update them according to what comes up and add concrete examples taken from the OnlyFEUP Project. These notes do not and do not intend to replace official documentation or attendance at theoretical classes. <br>
The most up-to-date notes can be found here:

### Project: OnlyFEUP Social Network (Grade: 18.6/20)

The main goal of the OnlyFEUP project is the development of a web-based social network with the purpose of creating connections between students and staff, sharing resources about courses and subjects. This is a tool that can be used by anyone from FEUP. After signing up and verifying the user is related to the university (students/teachers), they can start using it for a better experience at FEUP. <br>
Last year OnlyFEUP was also available online in the following link: `https://lbaw2255.lbaw.fe.up.pt`

All OnlyFEUP documentation is available in [Project](./Project/) folder:

- [Wiki](./Project/Wiki/), in markdown
- [Video Demo](./Project/docs/lbaw2255.mp4)
- [Final Report](./Project/Report.pdf) in PDF format with more than 200 pages
